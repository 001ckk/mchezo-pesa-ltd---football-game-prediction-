Prediction of football games 
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).

**Metric of success**

Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Feature Engineering: Figure out from the home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)


**Context**

After a long period testing and analysing the best way to calculate the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking, a new model took effect in August 2018 after approval by the FIFA Council.

This new version developed by FIFA was named "SUM" as it relies on adding/subtracting points won or lost for a game to/from the previous point totals rather than averaging game points over a given time period as in the previous version of the World Ranking.
